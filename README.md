========================
KalorieQ Client
========================

This is the new version of the KalorieQ Mobile App.  

KalorieQ was Originally developed natively for Android, but then I discovered Ionic 
and decided a platform upgrade was due.  Also this could allow the app to run on iOS
as well.

Here is the Youtube video I made quite many years ago as a "How To"

This is just the "Client" part of the application.

The server-side, currently sitting on www.kalorieq.com is written in php
and stored data in MySQL.  Later I may migrate this into AWS Lambda, or Azure DocumentDB.
